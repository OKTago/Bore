Adding types at runtime doesn't work as well as with apache
using django development server. If you are using the devel server
you must restart the server when you add a new type (it seems that urls are
not updated if you don't restart the server, so admin interface for example,
doesn't work)

UPDATE: Apache cause problems too :( 
        I should try to build a middleware. It will be executed on
        every request and must build object types
