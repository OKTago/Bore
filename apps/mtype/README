This app is used to have a different namespace for types.
For example using it we have different table prefix and
separated admin interface. Point one can be accomplished 
using models Meta inner classes but for point 2 I don't
know how to do it, so I have used different apps.

The cmodel.py file is intented to define custom models.
Custom models could have special defined functions or
other nasty things that are difficult to define via user 
interface.
